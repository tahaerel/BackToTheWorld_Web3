# BackToTheWorld_Web3

Project Overview
An epidemic is about to start on our planet! We must immediately build a rocket and return to Earth.

We can't stay here forever.

In Back to the World, our goal is to use our resources wisely, build new resource producers, upgrade existing ones, and construct the rocket as soon as possible, which is our last hope to survive the outbreak.

Game Tips
Diggers should be placed on gray or blue minerals. Gray minerals provide iron resources, and blue minerals provide water resources. A digging tool placed on an empty space will not produce anything.

The rover vehicle is required to make the map visible.

Technologies Used
Solana Blockchain: In-game asset management and verification are handled through the Solana blockchain.
Unity: The game was developed using the Unity game engine.
Magicblock: Magicblock is used for Web3 integration.
